I have good new for you Joanne. Let's go throught it:

1. Spreadsheet is a poor way of mantaining data. The new thing (well, not so new) is relational database. You can migrate your spreadsheet here: 
    /migrate-spreadsheet

2. Do you remember that excruciating job of copying and pasting from a xml file. You don't need to do it anymore. You can migrate the xml here:
    /migrate-xml

3. I really don't know whence do you get phone and mail from the fans, considering you don't have any means of contact. But wherever it is, you can check the records here:
    /all-fans
the incomplete (no phone, no mail) ones here:
    /incomplete-fans
in this url you will have a link to complete. The link looks like that:
    /individual-fan/{id}

4. When you want say hello to the fans, just go to this link:
